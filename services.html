<h2>Intuitive Tarot Readings</h2>
<br>
<p>Are you trying to understand the energy dynamics within a relationship?
  Do you need clarity on how to overcome adversity? Do you wish to change your
  story, but don’t know where to begin? Intuitive Readings help identify and release
  negative patterns and outdated beliefs that are limiting you from your highest potential.
   I receive information mainly through clairsentience (clear feeling) and claircognizance (clear knowing). By tuning
   into your energy field and connecting with your Spirit Guides, I use Tarot to convey dominant themes and lessons
    that are currently at play in your life.</p>

  <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
  <br>
<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make
  sure that content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and
   accessible. I pride myself on writing CSS3 that is easy to read and build on.
    I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and make it a habit to
     stay up to date on current front-end best practices. You can trust me to take a
     designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a mobile-first fully responsive
      website that is pixel-perfect match, whether it's a landing page or business website.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
 <ul>
<li><h3>How will I receive my Intuitive Tarot Reading?</h3>
  <p>You will receive a PDF document containing an extensive written interpretation
     of your Intuitive Reading along with a picture of your unique Tarot spread
  (via email within 72 hours of payment received). Live readings are not offered at this time.</p></li>

<li><h3>Do we need to meet in person for the reading to be more accurate?</h3>
<p>Rest assured that time and distance do not affect a reading's accuracy.</p></li>

<li><h3>Do you use specific Tarot spreads when giving readings?</h3>
<p>I intuitively pull as many cards I feel are necessary, depending
  on the complexity of the reading.</p></li>

<li><h3>What can I expect from an Intuive Tarot Reading?</h3>
<p>Results vary for everyone, but overall, Intuitive Tarot Readings are uplifting
  and provide clarity, heal old wounds, bring higher awareness on unhealthy triggers and
  behavioral tendencies in order to shift them, and help you better understand your Soul's purpose
  in this lifetime.</p></li>

<li><h3>How can I get the most out of an Intuitive Tarot Reading?</h3>
<p>Set positive intentions beforehand. Release any expectations and be open to what IS.</p></li>

<li><h3>How can I formulate a clear question for an Intuitive Tarot Reading?</h3>
<p>Ask questions that begin with How/What/Why
and avoid asking questions that begin with Should/Will/When.</p></li>

<li><h3>Do you predict the future?</h3>
<p>This has always been a common misconception about intuitive work. Intuitive readings of any
kind are meant to offer a Higher perspective that is channeled from Divine Spirit helpers and Higher Self. While
it is possible to tune into a possible outcome based on current life path energies, nothing is ever set in stone
because of free will.

<li><h3>Are Intuitive Tarot Readings safe?</h3>
<p>Yes, very safe! There's no reason to fear this kind of work, as it's aligned
to Divine Source/All That Is. </p></li>

<li><h3>Can you communicate with Spirits that have crossed over?</h3>
<p>I do not offer Mediumship readings at this time.</p></li>

<li><h3>Where can I find additional information on your services?</h3>
<p>Please contact me for pricing information and all other inquiries.</p></li>
