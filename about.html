  <p>I'm a self-taught intuitive tarot reader and web developer. I always had a
  vision of merging tech with my spiritual work.
The deeper I went into my "woo woo" endeavors, the more I realized I need an online presence
in order to serve others. At first, I tried building a personal website through
cookie-cutter website builder platforms, but never felt satisfied because of their
limitations.This inspired me to learn how to build websites from scratch,
not only to launch my own site, but to also help spiritual entrepreneurs who
have no technical background and wish to put themselves out there.</p>
<br>
<p>I understand the struggle of being an intuitive reader, energy healer, life coach,
  astrologer, etc. and having SO much to offer, yet feeling overwhelmed with how
  to build an online presence. As I started dabbling with code, I realized I found something that gave me the
 freedom & versatility I was looking for in my spiritual work. Now I can use my creativity and eye for
  detail to build any kind of website imagineable for myself and others.</p>

  <h1>Mission</h1>
  <p>This sacred space is meant to empower those
     on the non-linear path to individuation. While Tarot is the main focus, you
      will also explore a variety of topics such as Astrology, Jungian Psychology, Creative Visualization, Meditation, Intuitive
      Development, Dreamwork, Hermeticism, Eastern Philosophy, Holistic Healing, Crystals, Ritual, Grief Work, and much more. My goal
      is not to dogmatize, but to offer loving support and share knowledge.
      No matter where you are on your spiritual journey, beginner or veteran,
      there is something for everyone here. Stick with whatever resonates.</p>
<br>
      <p>Esotericism has been an undying passion of mine since I can remember. I've always sensed
      that there's something larger than life, a unifying Higher intelligence. Having experienced extreme
      loss in my childhood thinned the veil to Spirit and expanded my perspective on life, death,
      and the Universe. I envision myself helping others connect to their own Divine truth.</p>
